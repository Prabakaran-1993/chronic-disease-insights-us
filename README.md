# U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project analyzes the **CDC’s Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)** dataset, which tracks public health measures such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other chronic conditions across U.S. states and years.  
The goal is to extract insights, visualize trends, and demonstrate data storytelling skills for portfolio and recruiter visibility.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess large public health datasets
- Explore chronic disease indicators by topic, state, and year
- Visualize trends using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Highlight actionable insights for public health policy and awareness
- Showcase a recruiter‑ready analytics workflow in Jupyter/Colab

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Environment**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [CDC Chronic Disease Indicators](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators)
- Format: CSV
- Key columns:
  - `YearStart`, `YearEnd` – reporting year
  - `LocationDesc` – U.S. state/territory
  - `Topic` – health category (e.g., Cancer, Diabetes, Tobacco Use)
  - `Question` – specific indicator
  - `DataValue` – numeric value (percentage, rate, etc.)
  - `StratificationCategory` – demographic breakdowns

---

## 📊 Example Analyses
- **Smoking prevalence by state (2020)** – bar chart comparison
- **Obesity trends over time** – line chart across states
- **Diabetes prevalence distribution** – boxplot by year
- **Regional differences** – average indicator values by state
